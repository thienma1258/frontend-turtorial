        </h1>
        <p>
            Open Notepad to write your HTML code in. You will also need to open
            Netscape or Explorer to view the results. It
            doesnt matter whether you are connected to the Internet or not when
            you are working on these assignments. For
            the first part of the course, you will not be putting anything out
            on the web.
            <br>
            When I am coding HTML, I keep both Notepad and the browser I am
            using open so I can switch back and forth. Once
            you have opened the page in your browser, using the refresh key in
            the browser will show the latest saved
            version of the page you are working on.
        </p>
        <p>
            This assignment should be passed in via email as an attachment. Here
            is what I want you to do:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Save the web page as you are working on it with an .html or
                    .htm extension.</li>
                <li>Just before you plan to send it to me, save it with a .txt
                    extension.</li>
                <li>Send me the page with the .html or .htm extension and the
                    page with the .txt extension as attachments to
                    your email.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason for this is that depending on your email provider,
            sometimes the code gets changed in the .html or
            .htm version. Sending me the .txt version allows me to see the
            original code.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>
            <b>Steps:</b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To do your assignment, you should first open Notepad. Do a very
                simple web page using the very basic HTML
                code so you can test something simple.</li>
            <li>Save it with an .html or .htm extension.</li>
            <li>Go to Netscape Communicator and select FILE/OPEN PAGE or go to
                Explorer and select FILE/OPEN. Depending on
                the version you are using, you may see something else but try to
                find something that allows you to open a
                page. You then need to select the file. Note that in Explorer
                you BROWSE.</li>
            <li>Look at the results of your code. If it worked the way you want
                it to you are on your way. If not you need
                to return to the HTML in Notepad and make some changes, save the
                page with the changes and refresh in the
                browser to see the new version.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To do this page effectively, I suggest that you look at my PowerPoint
            Presentations. Specifically look at the first two in the list.
            <a href="http://www.pgrocer.net/PFGCIS44.html#presentations">Presentations</a>
        </p>
        <p>I also suggest that you look at my sample web pages unter HTML sample
            pages.
            <a href="http://www.pgrocer.net/CIS44sampcode.html#HTML">Samples -
                look at the first 6 in the list</a>
            <br>
            When you look at web pages, you can see the HTML code by going to
            VIEW in your browser and looking for SOURCE or PAGE SOURCE or
            something similiar. The key word here is source.
        </p>

    <h2><b>The web page you pass into me should have the following elements:</b></h2>
